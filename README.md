# üñ•Ô∏è Paging Simulator

A visual **Paging Algorithm Simulator** built using React.js to demonstrate how different **page replacement algorithms** (FIFO, LRU, Optimal) work in **memory management**.  
It provides step-by-step visualization, hit/miss ratio analysis, and algorithm comparison for better understanding of Operating System concepts.

## üß† **Algorithms Implemented**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
The oldest page in memory is replaced first.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ LRU (Least Recently Used)
The page that has not been used for the longest period is replaced.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimal
Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future.
